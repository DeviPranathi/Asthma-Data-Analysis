Asthma Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing healthcare expenditures related to asthma and the factors influencing these costs using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). The study explores the impact of aspirin intake on total healthcare expenditure, the relationship between age and healthcare visits, and the statistical correlations between key variables. Various data preprocessing techniques were applied, including filtering data using the ICD-10 code J45, handling missing values, and removing duplicate entries. Statistical analyses such as Pearson correlation, Chi-square tests, and the Mann-Whitney U test were conducted to evaluate significant relationships. The findings indicate that aspirin users tend to have more consistent healthcare costs, while non-users exhibit higher expenditure variability. Additionally, a weak positive correlation was observed between age and healthcare visits. Visualizations like histograms and box plots were used to illustrate the distribution and trends within the dataset. The project highlights the significance of tailored healthcare strategies for asthma management and emphasizes the role of data analytics in improving healthcare decision-making.
